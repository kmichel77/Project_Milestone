#cont. of milestone 2

#Description of dataset:

#Datasets appear like they were collected by a health department within CA or Los Angeles. The data that was collected includes cases of flu as well as vaccine uptake data. Timeframe of each dataset ranges between 2020-2023 within different counties across California.

#Question/statement: Reporting whether there’s any correlation between flu vaccination rates and covid vaccination rates.

#The dataset provides vaccination rates within many counties in california as well as the amount of cases. This will allow us to conduct our analysis in order to determine whether there’s any correlation between flu and covid vaccination rates by running appropriate statistical tests.

#5+ data types:

# -Population sizes 
#This information is essential as it’ll allow us to conduct our calculations in order to determine rates.

# -Cumulative up to date vaccinated/unvaccinated (exposure)
#Will be using this data to calculate vaccination rates in order to compare them to flu rates among exposed and unexposed

# -Current infected (outcome)
#Will be using this data (incidence rate) to compare to exposed and unexposed populations (vaccinated/unvaccinated)

# -New severe
#Will be using this data (incidence rate) to compare to exposed and unexposed populations (vaccinated/unvaccinated)

# -County
#Could be a confounding variable. Could assess whether some counties have higher vaccination/flu rates which would be considered a disparity.

# -Age 
#Could be a counting variable as well. We could use direct standardization in order to see the crude rates among different age groups in order to assess whether certain age groups have higher rates than others.

#Data cleaning:

#Completed:
# -renamed all dataset column names by snake case
# -Changed LACounty flu “dt_dx” column from chr string to date, then arranges in chronological order + removed extra columns + moved “date” column to first

#Need to be cleaned:
# -Demographic value needs to be reformatted from chr to num (ca_vax)
# -age needs to be reformatted from chr to num (LACounty_flu)
# -Age_cat needs to be reformatted from chr to number (ca_flu)
# -Ethnicity needs to be reformatted from num to chr (ca_flu)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
